"""
Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that
is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited
to just dictionary words.

I really like this problem because of the simple, elegant solution that it uses
